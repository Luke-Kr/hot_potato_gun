# About Hot Potato Gun
This addon adds a minigame to TTT using [Minigame Manager for TTT](https://asset.party/smartmario/ttt_sm1minigames). The minigame gives everyone a radar and a random player a ticking gun at the start of the round. Shooting an other player transfers the gun to that player. After 30 seconds have passed the player holding the gun explodes.

If a player holding the gun dies from any cause (including by holding the gun at detonation), the gun will be transferred to a new random player. Shooting a player does not do any damage and the timer will be set to 5 seconds if it was lower, to give the player a chance to retaliate.

This addon can be used to give players the Hot Potato Gun when creating a minigame. The gun cannot be bought in the traitor menu nor spawn in the map.
